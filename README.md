# Deception-Detection-using-speech-and-gesture-analysis
Abstract
Speech and gesture are interlinked components and are critical for felicitous communication. Both these components have certain characteristics and when convoluted together, they open up greater insights about psychological aspects of the human brain. We have used a convoluted framework and combined both approaches to generate a more robust tool for deception analysis. The model will find a great application in interrogative environments where human interactions cannot be completely trusted for deriving results.

We also wish to introduce a new kind of approach with our framework to expand our research into the field of medical diagnosis, by using Autism detection as an application to our underlying framework. Through this approach we wish to address the problem of early autism detection which is difficult to ascertain through regular clinical practice, this would enable early diagnosis and early treatment of the concerned problem.
